Let's change this, one website at a time! **Bear Cub** is a
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme based on [Hugo
Bear](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/) that takes care of speed and
optimization, so you can focus on writing good content.

It is free, multilingual, optimized for search engines, no-nonsense, responsive,
light, and fast. Really fast.

When compared to its predecessor, **Bear Cub** has a few
[privacy](https://themarkup.org/blacklight?url=clente.github.io/hugo-bearcub/)
and
[accessibility](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclente.github.io%2Fhugo-bearcub%2F)
upgrades. It's also compatible with modern
[security](https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub#secure) standards, so your
users don't have to worry about browsing your website.
