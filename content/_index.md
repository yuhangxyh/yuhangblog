# Welcome

under construction.

Thank you for visiting my website!

I am Yuhang Xu/徐雨航, currently a joint Ph.D. student from the Department of Linguistics and the Department of Brain & Cognitive Sciences, University of Rochester. I am working with Dr. Jeffrey Runner and Dr. Michael K. Tanenhaus at the U of R as well as Dr.Qingrong Chen at the Nanjing Normal University.



Let's change this, one website at a time! **Bear Cub** is a
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme based on [Hugo
Bear](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/) that takes care of speed and
optimization, so you can focus on writing good content.

It is free, multilingual, optimized for search engines, no-nonsense, responsive,
light, and fast. Really fast.
